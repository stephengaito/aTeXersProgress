# TextAdept 

This directory contains a collection of Lua code files which 
adds LaTeX and ConTeXt capabilities to the TextAdept editor.

# Dependencies

We provide a number of [Textadept](https://foicica.com/textadept/) 
modules which together with TextAdept provides a powerful configurable 
IDE for both LaTeX and ConTeXt. Please see the [Textadept installation 
instructions](https://foicica.com/textadept/manual.html#Installation) 
for details on installing Textadept.

Navigating a large LaTeX or ConTeXt project is critical. We use 
[Exuberant-CTags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) and the TextAdept 
module [Texredux](http://rgieseke.github.io/textredux/) to provide this 
navigation. Please see their relevant installation instructions for 
details for details on installation on your system.
